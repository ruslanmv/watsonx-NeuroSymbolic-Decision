# Rule Agent Service

This is a Python Rule Agent Service implementing a REST API to interface LLMs and Decision Services. 

## Setup 

In the directory, install Python requirements: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or alternatively
```
python3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the service, use the following command:

```

Note: if you want to deploy the ODM ruleapp for the HR Service sample, use the ```serverStart.sh``` shell script.
