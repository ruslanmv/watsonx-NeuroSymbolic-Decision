# Decision Services

This directory contains some examples of Decision Services that can be deployed in ODM Decision Server. 

## How to run ODM

Use the script `start_odm.sh` to start a basic ODM topology with a Decision Center and a Decision Server. 

ODM Decision Server needs to be started before deploying a Decision Service into it. 

When ODM is started, use the URL http://localhost:9060⁠ to display a welcome page that lists all the ODM components. You can also directly access the individual components through the following URLs:

| Component | URL | Username | Password |
|----------|----------|----------|---------- |
| Decision Server console⁠    | http://localhost:9060/res⁠   | odmAdmin   | odmAdmin |
| Decision Server Runtime⁠    | http://localhost:9060/DecisionService⁠   | odmAdmin   | odmAdmin |
| Decision Center Business console⁠    | http://localhost:9060/decisioncenter⁠   | odmAdmin   | odmAdmin |
| Decision Runner⁠    | http://localhost:9060/DecisionRunner   | odmAdmin   | odmAdmin |
| Sample application    | http://localhost:9060/loan-server   | odmAdmin   | odmAdmin |
